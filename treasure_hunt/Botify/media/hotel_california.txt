On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
Head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
"This could be heaven or this could be hell"
Then she lit up a candle
She showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
Thought I heard them say 6C
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
There's plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year), oh, you can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz, uh
She got a lot of pretty-pretty boys
Who she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
