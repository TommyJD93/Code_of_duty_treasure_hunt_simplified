What's the difference between me and you?
What's the difference between me and you?
Back when Cube was rolling with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was banging with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business
But sometimes the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga, Doc, and Eazy, I'm still with you
Fuck the beef, nigga, I miss you and that's just being real with you
You see the truth is everybody wanna know
How close me and Snoop is and who I'm still cool with
Then I got these fake-ass niggas I first blew with
Claiming that they non-violent, talking like theyâ€”(Do not resist the beat)
Spit venom in interviews, speaking on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speaking your name
Just keep my name outta your mouth and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting
