I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many player-hatin' - tryna sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'
Straight to the depths of Hell is where them cowards goin'
Well, are you still down? Holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of - every time we ride
Hittin' - up when we pass by
Until I die, live the life of a boss player, 'cause even when I'm high
F- with me and get crossed later, the futures in my eyes
'Cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-oh Benz, flauntin' flashy rings
Uhh, - pursue me like a dream
Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a - razor blade
Say money bring - bring lies
One - gettin' jealous and - die
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got four niggas in low riders and ski masks
Screamin', "Thug Life" every time they pass, all eyes on me
Live the life of a thug - until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug - until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
