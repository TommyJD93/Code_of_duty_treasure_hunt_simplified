It's bugging me
Grating me
And twisting me around
Yeah, I'm endlessly
Caving in
And turning inside out
'Cause I want it now
I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
And I'm breaking out
I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control
And it's holding me
Morphing me
And forcing me to strive
To be endlessly
Cold within
And dreaming I'm alive
'Cause I want it now
I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
I'm not breaking down
I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control
And I want you now
I want you now
I feel my heart implode
And I'm breaking out
Escaping now
Feeling my faith erode
