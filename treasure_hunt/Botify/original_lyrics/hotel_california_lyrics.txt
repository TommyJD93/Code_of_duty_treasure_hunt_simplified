On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
Head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
"This could be heaven or this could be hell"
Then she lit up a candle
She showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
Thought I heard them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
There's plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year), oh, you can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz, uh
She got a lot of pretty-pretty boys
Who she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the captain
Please bring me my wine, he said
"We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
We're living it up at the Hotel California
Oh, what a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling
With pink champagne on ice, and she said
"We are all just prisoners here of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
Stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
Had to find the passage back to the place I was before
"Relax", said the night man
"We are programmed to receive"
